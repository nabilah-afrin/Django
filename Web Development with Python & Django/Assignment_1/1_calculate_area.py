# You are a carpenter working on a project to create rectangular wooden tabletops. You need to calculate the total area of each tabletop to determine the amount of paint required for finishing. The length and width of each tabletop are measured in meters. Write a Python program that takes user input for the length and width ofa rectangular tabletop, calculates the area of the tabletop.

# user inputs
length = float(input())
width = float(input())

# area for each table top
print(f"Area of a table top is {length*width} square meters.")
